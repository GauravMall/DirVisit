# DirVisit
This library was created as a result of a StackOverflow Query about how to open a directory. The question can be found here: [Android open an external directory using an intent](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57670811/android-open-an-external-directory-using-an-intent/57670970)

It is meant to be the tool which allows you to do a variety of tasks associated with navigating the local and external storage of any Android device. Specifically you can:
- Open any directory on the device using the directory's file path.
- Open any of the pre-designated directories like `Folders.Download`
- Open any file with it's file path using the default installed app*

*Beware that any attempt at opening any file that isn't supported by the mobile device is obviously going to fail.

# Development
Development is about to start. COVID-19 was something of a double-edged knife. With this free time, hopefully the beta version will be introduced by the end of/middle of April 2020.
